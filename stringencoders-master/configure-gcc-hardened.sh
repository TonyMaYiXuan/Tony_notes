# -Wno-padded padding can change by OS/version this check is really
#   for embedded systems so it's ok to skip
#
# -Wno-covered-switch-default Don't warn if we have a switch that
#  covers all of an enum AND we have a default.  enums are only losely
#  typed, it's good to have a default: assert(0) in case someone does
#  a bad cast, etc also this conflicts with GCC checks.
